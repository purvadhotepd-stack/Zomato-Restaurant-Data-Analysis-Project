# Zomato-Restaurant-Data-Analysis-Project
Performed exploratory data analysis on Zomato restaurant data using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. Analyzed customer preferences, pricing, and ratings to identify key trends. Delivered actionable insights to optimize restaurant performance and pricing strategies.
The Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis Project focused on uncovering meaningful insights from restaurant data to understand customer behavior, pricing patterns, and performance trends across various locations. The project involved end-to-end data handling — from data collection and cleaning to visualization and insight generation — using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.

The dataset was first cleaned and transformed using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values, standardize data formats, and prepare it for analysis. SQL queries were applied for data extraction, filtering, and aggregation to identify key patterns in ratings, cuisines, cost distributions, and online delivery preferences.

Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI and Tableau to visually present findings such as top-performing restaurants, most popular cuisines, and correlations between pricing and customer ratings. These visualizations enabled a deeper understanding of factors influencing customer satisfaction and restaurant success.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project revealed that pricing, location, and online delivery availability significantly impacted customer ratings. Based on these insights, data-driven recommendations were proposed to help restaurant businesses optimize pricing strategies, improve service offerings, and enhance customer engagement.

Overall, the project demonstrated strong analytical, visualization, and storytelling skills — effectively transforming raw data into actionable insights to support strategic decision-making in the food and restaurant industry.
